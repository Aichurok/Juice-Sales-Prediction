# Juice-Sales-Prediction
In order to find the best prediction model for sales, we compare four different models, namely multiple
linear regression (MLR) estimated by OLS, stepwise regression, LASSO, and Ridge regression. 
The this purpose R was used. 

***DATA***
The dataset we use for the purpose of this paper is obtained from one store from Dominick’s Finer Foods
chain in the greater Chicago area. The data covers weekly observations on the sales of orange juice for a
total of 104 weeks in the period from January 1991 to December 1992. Included in the dataset are variables
that represent unit sales, shelf prices and a binary variable, promotion, that indicates the presence of
non-price promotion. Observations on these variables are available for eight Store Keeping Units (SKU)
in the refrigerated subcategory. Given potential competitive effects, weekly category sales, prices and
promotion intensity for the two subcategories of frozen and shelf storable orange juice are included as
well. Promotion intensity denotes the percentage of SKUs in that subcategory with a promotion. The
eight SKUs in the refrigerated subcategory, which are the objects of our research, are differentiated by
size and brand name. These are listed below.
